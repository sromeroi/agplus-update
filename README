# AmigaGames+ Updater in Python 1.4

Simple script created in 1996's Python 1.4 to allow System Updates in the AmigaGames+ Amiga distribution.

I had to use Python 1.4 because is the only version capable of running on a vanilla Amiga 1200 without hardware accelerators. This implies not having real OOP, only a few standard libraries available, no True/False, no SSL support and a large etc of inconveniences when developing it during a weekend but in the end, it allows AmigaGames+ users to easily upgrade their distribution with the "Upgrade Scripts" created by the AmigaGames+ maintainer.

You can find included with the package a set of update files to see the "update scripts" format.
